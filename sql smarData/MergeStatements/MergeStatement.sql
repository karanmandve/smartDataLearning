1] The MERGE statement in SQL is a very popular clause that can handle 
   inserts, updates, and deletes all in a single transaction 
   without having to write separate logic for each of these. 
   
2] You can specify conditions on which you expect the MERGE statement to insert, update, or delete, etc.

3] Using the MERGE statement in SQL gives you better 
   flexibility in customizing your complex SQL scripts and
   also enhances the readability of your scripts. 
   
4] The MERGE statement basically modifies an existing table 
   based on the result of comparison between the key fields with 
   another table in the context.

1] MERGE INTO TargetTable AS target: Specifies the target table and assigns it an alias.
2] USING SourceTable AS source: Specifies the source table and assigns it an alias.
3] ON target.ID = source.ID: Defines the join condition between the target and source tables.
4] WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET ...: Specifies the update action when a match is found.
5] WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN INSERT ...: Specifies the insert action 
6] when there is no match in the target table.
7] WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE THEN DELETE: Specifies the delete action 
when there is no match in the source table.
