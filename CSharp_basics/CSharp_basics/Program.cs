 * A class is a blueprint for creating objects that 
 * encapsulate data and behavior.
 */

/* Interface Usage
 * An interface defines a contract that must be
 * implemented by classes.

 * A record is a reference type in C# primarily

/*Var usage
 * The var keyword allows you to declare a variable 
 * with implicit typing, 
 * letting the compiler infer the type.

/* Access Specifiers usage 
 * Access specifiers control the accessibility of 
 * classes, methods, and fields.
 * Common ones are public, private, 
 * protected, and internal.

 * which must be implemented by derived classes.
