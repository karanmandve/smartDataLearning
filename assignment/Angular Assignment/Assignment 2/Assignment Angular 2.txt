1) What is CSR, SSR, SSG and ISR ?

=>

i) Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
How it works: The browser downloads a minimal HTML file, along with JavaScript and CSS files. The JavaScript then dynamically fetches data and renders the content in the browser.
first html then js then css then js fetch data
Pros: Highly interactive user experience.
Cons: Slower initial page load and potential SEO challenges.

ii) Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
How it works: The server renders the web page and sends the fully-rendered HTML to the clientâ€™s browser. This allows the page to be displayed immediately.
Pros: Better SEO and faster initial page load.
Cons: Increased server load and complexity.

iii) Static Site Generation (SSG)
How it works: Pages are pre-rendered as static HTML files at build time. These files are then served to the user.
Pros: Excellent performance, scalability, and security.
Cons: Not suitable for highly dynamic content.

iv) Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
How it works: Combines the benefits of SSR and SSG. Some pages are pre-rendered at build time, while others are regenerated on-the-fly and cached for subsequent requests.
Pros: Balances performance and real-time data.
Cons: Requires careful management of dynamic data.
